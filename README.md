<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We have developed a cutting-edge attendance recorder which records attendance of the students using our face recognition model which has an accuracy of about 97%.  Using face recognition, you can easily record attendance and have access to in-depth analysis and a wide range of functionalities. Because of the covid-19 pandemic, stringent guidelines have been established, and precautions must be made to minimise unnecessary physical encounters. As a result, our method has shown to be effective in eliminating the requirement for any type of physical interaction while collecting and analysing attendance.

Detailed explanation of the project is given below.

You can view our research paper - [CaptureIt! - A Web-based Attendance System Using Face Recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9597350)
